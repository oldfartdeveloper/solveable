# Solveable Solitaire

The Klondike card game that is always solveable at selectable difficulty levels.

## Status

This is in early stages of development.  Hence, right now the command(s) available will be described so that you can try them for yourself.

To run the current command:

```zsh
cabal new-run solveable
```

TODO: deploy to GitHub as an executable so that you can just type `solveable`.

## Present Status:

When you run this as an executable, you are asked for a card number from 1 to 52, and it will draw you what the card will look like in the game.

## Installation
